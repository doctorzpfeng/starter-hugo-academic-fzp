abstract: Time-frequency (TF) signal features are widely used in specific emitter identification
(SEI) which commonly arises in many applications, especially for radar signals. Due to data
scale and algorithm complexity, it is difficult to obtain an informative representation for SEI
with existing TF features. In this paper, a feature extraction method is proposed based on
synchrosqueezing transform (SST). The SST feature has an equivalent dimension to Fourier transform,
and retains the most relevant information of the signal, leading to on average approximately
20 percent improvement in SEI for complex frequency modulation signals compared with existing
handcrafted features. Numerous results demonstrate that the synchrosqueezing TF feature can offer
a better recognition accuracy, especially for the signals with intricate time-varying information.
Moreover, a linear relevance propagation algorithm is employed to attest to the SST feature
importance from the perspective of deep learning.
