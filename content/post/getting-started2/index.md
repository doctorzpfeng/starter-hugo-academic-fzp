I was fully sponsored by a scholarship of Xidian University to study in University of Montenegro for one year at least (from March 2022 to March 2023). I have arrived
in Montenegro on 7, March, 2022 and then gave a series of lectures on interpretable AI with SAR images. The lectures were held successfully and highly acclaimed by the 
members of TFSA Group in University of Montenegro. 

The above photo  of all members of TFSA Group and me was taken after my lectures.
